# Description
Using HTML, CSS and Javascript (D3.js, Bootstrap, JQuery, NodeJS etc..) visualise the CSV data using the appropriate a graph(s) in a way that a user can filter between different countries, and regions. The Javascript code should be commented and readable.

# My Design approach
I chose to use a grouped bar chart, this allows you to see the increase or decrease of CPI scores for each country, and view it in relation to the other countries in that region.

# Functionality
Use drop down options to filter through regions or countries.

# Problems
I have an issue with the bar chart always displaying the first entry in the csv file despite filters being applied.
